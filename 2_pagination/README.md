# Pagination

Pagination is of 2 types-
    -   Frontend Heavy: Getting all data from backend and paginate it in frontend.
    -   Backend Heavy: Backend does the job, from frontend we just give page number and how many items we want.

## Questions to clarify?

1.  Where will the paginated data come from?
2.  Is API paginated?
3.  What if data is not present?
4.  What if API fails?


-> Fetch all Data
-> Setup Pagination
-> At last, focus on CSS
